The University of Zedland has an intake of 5000+ students per annum. A large
number of the students find their accommodation through the University
Accommodation Services. The accommodation varies from plush houses in upmarket
districts to flats studios and shared rooms in less salubrious parts of town.
Accomodation is graded using the same star system as hotels (e.g. 1 to 5). Up to
now, students have had to make an appointment at the accommodation services
offices in order to register an interest, or reserve a particular house, flat or
room. You have been tasked with designing a mobile application that will make
the process of finding and reserving accommodation for Zedland students much
easier. This assignment, produces a design for the whole application, and
implements the basic structure of the application, including main pages,
navigation and textual content.
